# UserService Microservice

## Overview

UserService is a microservice responsible for managing user accounts, including registration, login, and user data retrieval. It communicates with an external authentication service and employs a modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Project Structure

```

    ├── config             # Configuration files (e.g., environment variables)
    ├── controllers        # Controller functions for handling requests
    ├── middlewares        # Middleware functions for request processing
    ├── migrations         # Database migration files
    ├── models             # Sequelize models for database entities
    ├── repositories       # Data access layer for user-related operations
    ├── routes             # API route definitions
    ├── seeders            # Database seeding scripts
    ├── service            # Business logic and service layer
    └── utils              # Utility functions
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd userservice
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3001
   ```

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
node src/index.js
```

## API Endpoints

### User Management

- **POST /v1/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /v1/login**: Log in an existing user.
- **DELETE /v1/users/:userId**: Delete a user by ID.
- **GET /v1/users**: Retrieve all users.
- **GET /v1/user/:username**: Retrieve a user by username.
- **GET /v1/test**: Test endpoint to verify the API is working.

### Middleware

The middleware `checkUser` ensures that a user exists before processing certain requests.

## Error Handling

The application includes a centralized error handling mechanism to manage errors uniformly across endpoints.

## Database Migrations

Ensure to run any database migrations as needed. Migrations are located in the `migrations` directory.

## Logging

Logs are sent to a monitoring service using the `logMessage` utility, which sends log data to a designated logging endpoint.

## Running Tests

To run tests (if any), you can use:

```bash
npm test
```
